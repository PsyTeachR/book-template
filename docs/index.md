# Overview {-}

The best resource for creating a course book is the [bookdown website](https://bookdown.org/). Yihui Xie's [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) book can answer most of the questions you'll have. This guide is just a quick start for the specific templates we're using at UofG Psychology.

## Updating an existing book

Download the [psyTeachR Bookdown Course Template](files/book-template.zip), unzip it, and copy all the files to your existing project, overwriting any files. Check `_index_example.Rmd` for anything that might need to be updated in your existing `index.Rmd` file.
